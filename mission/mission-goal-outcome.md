# Learn about the goal and outcome of the mission

The goal of this mission is to learn how one can leverage *SAP AI Core* to manage the
lifecycle of an AI Asset. AI Core is part of the services portfolio that the SAP
Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP) offers.

As part of this mission one will upload a dataset, train a model and lastly serve the trained
model in order to make it available for inference requests on new incoming data. This
happens in a scalable and for the most part hyperscaler-agnostic way.

At the end of the mission one utilizes the model as part of an inference
service that runs in the cloud. A client can now send a data sample to the service endpoint and receive the
model's prediction based on that data as a response.
